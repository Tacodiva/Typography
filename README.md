# Typography

This is a fork of one of the weirdest projects I have ever seen. It contains a whole bunch of utilites for reading in font files and rendering text. The problem is it's a huge mess and very difficult for consumers to use. This fork kinda tames the mess but the code is still a bit of a disaster zone. Better than writing it myself lmao. Finding anything in here is a nightmare.

A lot of the code seems to have been translated directly from C or C++.

I have deleted all the PixelFarm examples and tried to make a 'meta-library' under the Typography namespace and folder purely to make using this library easier.
